### Template 1: Angel Investor - First Touch

**Subject:** Health verification meets lifestyle tech - $2B market disruption

---

Hi [First Name],

I noticed your investments in [relevant portfolio company] and thought CleanCheck might align with your thesis around [health tech / consumer safety / marketplace platforms].

**The Problem:** In lifestyle communities, dating, and professional settings, people need to verify health status—but current solutions expose private medical records or don't exist at all.

**Our Solution:** CleanCheck is a privacy-first health verification platform. Members complete lab-certified STD and toxicology testing, then share verified status via QR code—without exposing actual medical records.

**Traction:**
- 28+ partner venues across 11 countries
- $39/member subscription (60-day cycles)
- B2B revenue: $299-499/mo per venue
- Growing 15% MoM

**The Ask:** 15 minutes to share our deck and discuss fit?

Hi [First Name],

Given [Family Office]'s investments in [hospitality / nightlife / lifestyle], I wanted to introduce CleanCheck—we're solving trust and safety for venues and their patrons.

- Door Scanner app for venue staff
- Analytics dashboard for operators
- HIPAA-compliant, privacy-first

**Business model:**
- B2C: $39-129/member (subscription)
- B2B: $299-499/venue/month
- Lab kits: Direct product sales

**Current footprint:** 28+ venues across USA, LATAM, Europe, and Asia Pacific

We're raising seed capital to expand our venue network and would welcome a conversation.

Best regards,
