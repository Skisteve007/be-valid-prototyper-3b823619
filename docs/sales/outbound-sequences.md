## 1. Attorney / General Counsel

### Email 1: Initial Outreach (Short)

**Subject:** Constitutional AI that stands up in court

**Body:**
```
Hi [NAME],

We implement enforceable AI governance—human veto, multi-model consensus, immutable audits.

A 60-day pilot produces a defensible audit pack aligned to your risk posture.

If AI decisions ever need to be explained in court or to regulators, we provide cryptographic chain-of-custody.

Open to a 30-min overview?

### Email 2: Follow-up (Value Add)

**Subject:** Re: Constitutional AI that stands up in court

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

Quick follow-up. We're seeing legal teams prioritize AI governance for three reasons:

1. Liability exposure from AI hallucinations
2. Regulatory scrutiny (EU AI Act, state laws)
3. Discovery requirements for AI-generated content

Our 60-day pilot has helped [similar company type] establish defensible AI controls.

Worth 30 minutes?

Steven
```

### Email 3: Break-up

**Subject:** Closing the loop

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

I'll assume AI governance isn't a priority right now—totally understand.

If you ever need to reconstruct an AI decision for litigation or compliance, we're here.

Best,
Steven
```

## 2. CISO / Security Leader

### Email 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject:** Shadow AI is your next security incident

**Body:**
```
Hi [NAME],

Your employees are using AI tools you don't control. The question isn't if—it's how much.

SYNTH provides centralized governance across all AI touchpoints:
- Real-time monitoring of AI usage
- Enforceable policies, not just guidelines
- Immutable audit trail for every decision

60-day pilot to prove the model. Interested?

Steven Grillo
CEO, Giant Ventures LLC
```

### Email 2: Follow-up (Fear-Based)

**Subject:** Re: Shadow AI is your next security incident

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

Following up. Recent stat that might resonate:

67% of employees admit to using unauthorized AI tools at work. Each one is a potential data leak, compliance violation, or hallucination waiting to happen.

We help CISOs get visibility and control. Worth a quick call?

Steven
```

## 3. CIO / CTO

### Email 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject:** AI sprawl → AI governance

**Body:**
```
Hi [NAME],

AI is spreading across your org faster than IT can track.

SYNTH sits between your LLMs and your users—enforcing policies, logging decisions, enabling human oversight.

Think of it as the governance layer you wish you'd built from day one.

60-day pilot to prove ROI. Open to a brief call?

Steven Grillo
CEO, Giant Ventures LLC
```

### Email 2: Technical Value

**Subject:** Re: AI sprawl → AI governance

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

Quick follow-up with specifics:

- Model-agnostic (works with any LLM)
- API-first architecture
- <2 sec latency for inline decisions
- On-prem or cloud deployment

We're currently piloting with [similar company type]. Happy to share learnings.

Steven

## 4. VP Operations / Chief Risk Officer

### Email 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject:** AI outputs without governance = unlimited liability

**Body:**
```
Hi [NAME],

Every AI-generated decision your company makes is a potential liability without documentation.

We provide:
- Constitutional controls on AI outputs
- Immutable proof of what happened and why
- Human veto on high-stakes decisions

When regulators or plaintiffs come calling, we have the receipts.

60-day pilot to establish your governance baseline?

Steven Grillo
CEO, Giant Ventures LLC

## Call Scripts

### Discovery Call Opening
```
"Thanks for taking the time. Before I dive in, I'd love to understand your current AI landscape. 

How many AI tools would you estimate are being used across your organization today? 

And who currently has visibility into what those tools are producing?"
```

### Pivot to Pain
```
"Interesting. So if an AI-generated [document/decision/recommendation] was ever challenged—in court, by a regulator, or by a customer—could you reconstruct exactly what happened?"
```

### Bridge to Solution
```
"That's exactly the gap we address. SYNTH provides constitutional governance for AI—meaning every decision has an audit trail, human oversight is built in, and you can prove exactly what happened and why."
```

### Close to Next Step
```
"Here's what I'd suggest: a 60-day pilot focused on [2-3 high-risk workflows]. We implement governance controls, produce an audit pack, and prove the model. If it works, we expand. If not, you've still got a baseline. Make sense as a next step?"
```

---

## Objection Handling Scripts

### "We're not ready for AI governance"
```
"That's exactly why starting with a pilot makes sense. Pick 2-3 workflows where the risk is highest, prove the model in 60 days, then decide on expansion. We meet you where you are."
```

### "Budget is tight"
```
"Totally understand. Let me ask—what would a single AI-related incident cost? Lawsuit, regulatory fine, reputation damage? A $75K pilot that prevents a $10M liability is 133x ROI. And we can structure payment across the engagement."
```

### "We need to involve more stakeholders"
```
"Makes complete sense. Who else should be part of the conversation? We typically work with [legal, security, tech leadership]. I'm happy to schedule a joint session or provide materials for internal circulation."
```

### Thought Leadership
```
AI governance isn't about slowing down innovation.

It's about building the audit trail that lets you move fast with confidence.

Every AI decision. Documented. Explainable. Defensible.

That's what constitutional AI looks like.

```

### Case Study Teaser
```
Just wrapped a 60-day pilot with a [industry] company.

Results:
✅ 3 high-risk workflows now governed
✅ 100% audit trail coverage
✅ Zero governance failures
✅ Board presentation: "This is what we've been asking for"

DM if you want to learn how we did it.
