## 7-Seat Senate Architecture

**Every client receives the full 7-Seat Senate — no exceptions.**

| Seat | Role | Current Provider |
|------|------|------------------|
| 1 | Chief Judge | OpenAI (GPT-4o) |
| 2 | Executive Secretary | Anthropic (Claude 3.5) |
| 3 | Senator | Google (Gemini 1.5) |
| 4 | Senator | Meta (Llama 3) |
| 5 | Senator | DeepSeek (V3) |
| 6 | Senator | Mistral (Large) |
| 7 | Senator | xAI (Grok) |

### Seat Interchangeability Policy

Seats are **model-agnostic and interchangeable**. If a new LLM enters the market and outperforms an incumbent on:
- Drift benchmarks (stability over time)
- Hallucination rates (simplistic to complex questioning)
- Consensus accuracy

...it earns a seat. Clients are buying **governance architecture**, not vendor lock-in.
