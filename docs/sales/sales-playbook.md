# Grillo AI Sales Playbook (v1.0)

## 1. Mission & Positioning

We govern AI with enforceable architecture: **SYNTH™ + Constitution**.

**Outcome:** Safe, auditable, human-sovereign AI at enterprise scale.

### Core Value Proposition
- **Constitutional AI Governance** — Enforceable rules, not just guidelines
- **7-Seat Senate Architecture** — Multi-model consensus for critical decisions
- **Immutable Audit Trail** — Cryptographic proof of every AI decision
- **Human Veto Power** — Humans remain in control at all times

### Positioning Statement
> "We implement enforceable AI governance with human veto, multi-model consensus, and immutable audits. When AI decisions need to be explained, we provide cryptographic chain-of-custody."

## 2. Target Verticals & ICP

### Primary Verticals
1. **Legal** — Law firms, corporate counsel, compliance teams
2. **Finance** — Banks, investment firms, insurance companies
3. **Healthcare** — Hospital systems, pharmaceutical, biotech
4. **Public Sector** — Government agencies, defense contractors

### Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
- Organizations deploying AI in high-stakes decision-making
- Companies facing regulatory scrutiny (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX)
- Enterprises with "Shadow AI" risk across workforce
- Leaders needing defensible AI audit trails

### Key Personas
| Persona | Pain Point | Our Solution |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| General Counsel / CLO | Liability from AI hallucinations | Constitutional controls + audit pack |
| CISO | Shadow AI security risks | Centralized governance + monitoring |
| CIO / CTO | AI sprawl, no oversight | SYNTH orchestration layer |
| Chief Risk Officer | Regulatory exposure | Immutable proof records |
| VP Operations | Inconsistent AI outputs | Consensus-based verification |

## 3. Discovery Framework

### Opening Questions
1. "How many AI tools are currently deployed across your organization?"
2. "Who has visibility into what your AI systems are producing?"
3. "If an AI-generated decision was challenged in court, could you reconstruct the reasoning?"
4. "What's your current process for auditing AI outputs?"

### Pain Uncovery
- "What happens when an AI makes a mistake today?"
- "How do you currently enforce AI usage policies?"
- "What would it cost if an AI hallucination became public?"

### Qualification Criteria (BANT+)
- **Budget:** $5K-$5M range based on scope
- **Authority:** Access to legal, compliance, or C-suite
- **Need:** Active AI deployment with governance gaps
- **Timeline:** 60-90 days to pilot readiness
- **Risk Awareness:** Understanding of AI liability exposure

## 4. Objection Handling

### "We already have AI guidelines"
> "Guidelines are a start. The question is: can you prove enforcement? SYNTH provides cryptographic evidence that rules were followed—defensible in court, useful for regulators."

### "Our AI is already safe"
> "Safe is good. Provably safe is better. When regulators or plaintiffs ask for evidence, guidelines won't hold up. Our audit trail shows exactly what happened, why, and who approved it."

### "Too expensive"
> "Compare to the cost of one AI-related lawsuit, regulatory fine, or reputation hit. A $75K pilot that prevents a $10M liability is 133x ROI before you count operational benefits."

### "We're not ready for AI governance"
> "That's exactly why a pilot makes sense. Start with 2-3 high-risk workflows, prove the model, then expand. We meet you where you are."

## 5. Competitive Differentiation

| Competitor Approach | Our Advantage |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Model-specific guardrails | Model-agnostic, works with any LLM |
| Manual review processes | Automated consensus with human veto |
| Logging-only solutions | Enforceable controls, not just observation |
| Point solutions | Full constitutional framework |

### The Moat
1. **We Own the Trust Layer** — Not just features, the governance standard
2. **Platform, Not Product** — Expands across all AI touchpoints
3. **Revenue Compounds** — More workflows = more value
4. **Regulation Is Our Friend** — Stricter rules = more demand
